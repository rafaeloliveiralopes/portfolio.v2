## 1. About the Project

This project aims to create a landing page for showcasing web development services. The primary goal is to present the developer's capabilities, collect potential clients' information, display a portfolio of previous projects, and provide a contact section with developer information. The landing page needs to be SEO optimized, mobile friendly, visually appealing, and user-friendly to effectively capture the interest of potential clients.

### Scope and Needs

- **Presentation of Services**: Clearly and attractively present the web development services offered.
- **Information Collection**: Include a form for potential clients to submit their information (name, email, type of service interested in, etc.).
- **Portfolio Display**: Showcase previous projects to demonstrate the developer's skills and experience.
- **Contact Information**: Provide easy access to the developer's contact information and a form for direct inquiries.
- **SEO Optimization**: Ensure the landing page is optimized for search engines to increase visibility.

## 2. Main Features

- **Services Section**: Introduces the visitor to the services offered.
- **Contact Form**: Allows visitors to leave their contact information and inquire about services.
- **Portfolio**: Displays previous work and projects.
- **About Me Section**: Provides background information about the developer, their skills, and experience.
- **SEO Features**: Implements SEO best practices to improve the landing page's search engine ranking.

## 3. Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Next.js**: Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, which enhance SEO and improve performance. Next.js also offers easy routing, which is beneficial for a single-page application like a landing page.

### Other Tools and Libraries

- **Nodemailer**: Used for sending emails from the contact form, enabling immediate communication with potential clients.
- **Vercel**: For hosting the Next.js application, providing easy deployment and high performance.
- **Husky**: For managing Git hooks.
- **lint-staged**: For running linters on staged files in Git.

The chosen technology stack and tools are aimed at creating a high-performance, maintainable, and scalable landing page that meets the project's goals and requirements.

## Project Setup

The project is configured with modern development practices in mind, integrating tools like ESLint for code quality, Prettier for consistent formatting, and TypeScript for type safety. Husky and `lint-staged` are used to ensure that commits meet the project's coding standards.

### Getting Started

To clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
npm install
```

### Running the Project

To start the development server:

```

### Linting and Formatting

Run the following command to lint the code:
