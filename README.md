## 3. Technology Stack and Rationale

### Frontend

- **Next.js**: Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, which enhance SEO and improve performance. Next.js also offers easy routing, which is beneficial for a single-page application like a landing page.

### Backend

- **Node.js with Express**: A popular choice for building RESTful APIs that can handle form submission data. Node.js offers scalability and compatibility with various databases and frontend technologies.

### Database

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that provides flexibility in storing form data from potential clients. It's chosen for its scalability, performance, and ease of integration with Node.js.

### Other Tools and Libraries

- **Mongoose**: Facilitates data modeling and simplifies interactions with MongoDB.
- **Nodemailer**: Used for sending emails from the contact form, enabling immediate communication with potential clients.
- **Formik** or **React Hook Form**: These libraries are considered for managing form state and validation on the frontend, offering simplicity and performance.
- **Vercel**: For hosting the Next.js application, providing easy deployment and high performance.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: A cloud database service that hosts MongoDB, offering reliability and easy scaling.

The chosen technology stack and tools are aimed at creating a high-performance, maintainable, and scalable landing page that meets the project's goals and requirements.
